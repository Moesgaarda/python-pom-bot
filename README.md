# Pom Bot

The default pom bot with simple features.

This version is made in Python3 and requires the discord.py wrapper:
`pip3 install discord.py` 

And the dotenv package:
`pip3 install python-dotenv`

In addition to this, it's made with a MongoDB database, which is set to be running on localhost port 27017, which is the default port.

After this has been set up, it should be plug and play! Enjoy!
